# E-commerce Micro Frontends Monorepo

## üõí Project Overview
This project is a modern e-commerce platform built as a monorepo using micro frontends architecture. It was developed for a practical challenge to demonstrate scalable, maintainable, and modular front-end solutions using Next.js 15, TailwindCSS v4, and a shared module for code reuse. The system is fully dockerized and orchestrated with Nginx as a reverse proxy.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- **Micro Frontend 1:** Home, Search, and Product Page (`apps/ecommerce`)
- **Micro Frontend 2:** Checkout (`apps/checkout`)
- **Shared Module:** Reusable components, hooks, and styles (`apps/shared`)
- **Orchestration:** Docker Compose + Nginx reverse proxy for seamless routing between micro frontends

```
/apps
  /ecommerce   # Home, Search, Product
  /checkout    # Checkout
  /shared      # Shared components, hooks, styles
/nginx         # Nginx reverse proxy config
docker-compose.yml
pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

## üöÄ Tech Stack
- [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces)
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) (shared module build)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) (testing)
- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) (reverse proxy)
- [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) (data source)

## üì° API Data (Fake Store API)
This project uses the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) as its data source for all product-related features. Below are the main endpoints and their usage:

### Main Endpoints
- **List all products:**
  - `GET https://fakestoreapi.com/products`
  - _Used on Home and Search pages to display all products._
- **Get product details:**
  - `GET https://fakestoreapi.com/products/{id}`
  - _Used on the Product Detail page to show information about a specific product._
- **List all categories:**
  - `GET https://fakestoreapi.com/products/categories`
  - _Used for filtering/searching products by category._
- **List products by category:**
  - `GET https://fakestoreapi.com/products/category/{category}`
  - _Used on Search or Home to filter products by category._
- **Cart/Checkout (optional):**
  - `GET https://fakestoreapi.com/carts/user/{userId}`
  - _Can be used to simulate cart retrieval for the checkout flow._

### Example Data Structure
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Fjallraven - Foldsack No. 1 Backpack, Fits 15 Laptops",
  "price": 109.95,
  "description": "Your perfect pack for everyday use and walks in the forest.",
  "category": "men's clothing",
  "image": "https://fakestoreapi.com/img/81fPKd-2AYL._AC_SL1500_.jpg",
  "rating": { "rate": 3.9, "count": 120 }
}
```

### Usage in Micro Frontends
- **Ecommerce (Home, Search, Product):**
  - Fetches product lists, product details, and categories for display and filtering.
- **Checkout:**
  - Can fetch cart data and display a summary of selected products (simulated, as the API is public and stateless).

For more details, see the [Fake Store API documentation](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs).

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (for local development)

### Running with Docker Compose
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd ecommerce-mfe
   ```
2. Start all services:
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```
3. Access the app:
   - `http://localhost/` ‚Üí Home, Search, Product (ecommerce)
   - `http://localhost/checkout` ‚Üí Checkout

### Local Development (optional)
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Build the shared module:
   ```sh
   cd apps/shared && pnpm build
   ```
3. Start each app in separate terminals:
   ```sh
   cd apps/ecommerce && pnpm dev
   cd apps/checkout && pnpm dev
   ```

## üß© Development Workflow
- All code reuse must go through the shared module (`apps/shared`).
- Use TailwindCSS utility classes for all styling.
- Follow accessibility best practices (aria-labels, roles, etc).
- Use descriptive and semantic naming for all variables, functions, and components.
- Use `const` for handlers and functions, and prefer early returns.
- Keep code DRY, clean, and well-commented when necessary.
- See [docs/checklist.md](docs/checklist.md) for a full implementation checklist.

## üß™ Testing
- Automated tests are required for all main flows (product listing, search, product details, checkout).
- Run tests with:
  ```sh
  pnpm test
  ```
- Prettier and ESLint are enforced via pre-commit hooks.

## ü§ù Contributing
- All new features and fixes must be developed in a separate branch.
- Submit a Pull Request with a clear description of the purpose and changes.
- All tests must pass before requesting a review.
- Do not merge directly into the main branch.
- See [rules](.cursor-rules.json) for full conventions and collaboration guidelines.

## üìú Rules & Conventions
- See [.cursor-rules.json](.cursor-rules.json) for all project rules, conventions, and architecture.
- All contributors must follow these rules to ensure code quality and consistency.

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Commit Messages

- All commits must be written in English.
- Use clear and descriptive messages to make the project history easy to understand.

## üìã Challenge Requirements
- Micro frontends architecture (ecommerce & checkout as separate apps)
- Data from Fake Store API
- Componentization and code reuse
- Responsive and accessible design
- UI library (TailwindCSS)
- Smooth navigation between micro frontends (via Nginx)
- Automated tests for main flows
- Docker Compose for local development
