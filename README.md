# E-commerce Micro Frontends Monorepo

## üõí Project Overview
This project is a modern e-commerce platform built as a monorepo using micro frontends architecture. It demonstrates scalable, maintainable, and modular front-end solutions using Next.js 15, TailwindCSS v4, and a shared module for code reuse. The system is fully dockerized and orchestrated with Nginx as a reverse proxy.

üîó Deploy: https://ecommerce.thomazot.com.br/

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- **Micro Frontend 1:** Home, Search, and Product Page ([apps/ecommerce](apps/ecommerce))
- **Micro Frontend 2:** Checkout ([apps/checkout](apps/checkout))
- **Shared Module:** Reusable components, hooks, and styles ([apps/shared](apps/shared))
- **Core Module:** Centralized global configuration for all apps ([apps/core](apps/core))
- **Orchestration:** Docker Compose + Nginx reverse proxy for seamless routing between micro frontends

```
/apps
  /ecommerce   # Home, Search, Product
  /checkout    # Checkout
  /shared      # Shared components, hooks, styles
  /core        # Global configs (Tailwind, ESLint, Jest, TSConfig)
/nginx         # Nginx reverse proxy config
docker-compose.yml
pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

## üöÄ Tech Stack
- [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [tailwind-variants](https://tailwind-variants.org/) (all styling via slots)
- [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces)
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) (shared module build)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) (testing)
- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) (reverse proxy)
- [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) (data source)

## ‚ú® Styling & Component Pattern
- **All styling is done exclusively with TailwindCSS utility classes.**
- **Every component uses [tailwind-variants](https://tailwind-variants.org/) with `slots` for all styled parts.**
- No Tailwind classes are allowed directly in JSX‚Äîalways use slots from the variant file.
- Example:
  ```ts
  // card.variants.ts
  export const card = tv({
    slots: {
      base: '...',
      image: '...',
      title: '...',
      price: '...',
      button: '...',
    }
  });
  ```
  ```tsx
  // Card.tsx
  const S = card();
  <article className={S.base()}>
    <img className={S.image()} ... />
    <h2 className={S.title()} ... />
    <p className={S.price()} ... />
    <button className={S.button()} ... />
  </article>
  ```
- **Mobile-first and fully responsive layouts.**
- **Accessibility is a must:** use roles, aria-labels, keyboard navigation, etc.
- **All style variables and classes are centralized in the `component.variants.ts` file.**
- **No inline or external CSS.**

## üöÄ CI/CD and Deploy

This project has continuous integration (CI/CD) using **GitHub Actions**. On every push to the `main` branch, the workflow automatically deploys to a Droplet on DigitalOcean, using Docker Compose to orchestrate the micro frontends.

- The published domain is: https://ecommerce.thomazot.com.br/
- The workflow copies the files via SSH and runs `docker compose up -d --build` on the remote server.

## üö¶ Recommended Development Workflow
1. Start shared in watch mode (in one terminal):
   ```sh
   pnpm --filter @ecommerce-mfe/shared... dev
   ```
2. In another terminal, start the desired app (ecommerce or checkout):
   ```sh
   pnpm --filter @ecommerce-mfe/ecommerce... dev
   # or
   pnpm --filter @ecommerce-mfe/checkout... dev
   ```
3. For production builds, use the `build` and `start` scripts for each app.
4. (Optional) Use a tool like `concurrently` to run multiple dev servers in one terminal.

## üß™ Lint, Prettier & Tests
- Lint, Prettier, and tests run automatically on pre-commit via Husky + lint-staged.
- To run manually:
  - `pnpm lint` ‚Äî Global lint.
  - `pnpm test:all` ‚Äî Global tests.

## üê≥ Docker
- Use the root `docker:*` scripts to build, start, and stop containers.

## üì° API Data (Fake Store API)
This project uses the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) as its data source for all product-related features. See the API docs for endpoints and usage.

## ‚ö° Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (for local development)

### Running with Docker Compose
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd ecommerce-mfe
   ```
2. Start all services:
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```
3. Access the app:
   - `http://localhost/` ‚Üí Home, Search, Product (ecommerce)
   - `http://localhost/checkout` ‚Üí Checkout

## üß© Development Workflow
- All code reuse must go through the shared module ([apps/shared](apps/shared)).
- **All styling must use Tailwind Variants with slots.**
- **No Tailwind classes in JSX.**
- Follow accessibility best practices (aria-labels, roles, etc).
- Use descriptive and semantic naming for all variables, functions, and components.
- Use `const` for handlers and functions, and prefer early returns.
- Keep code DRY, clean, and well-commented when necessary.
- See [docs/checklist.md](docs/checklist.md) for a full implementation checklist.

## üß™ Testing
- Automated tests are required for all main flows (product listing, search, product details, checkout).
- Run tests with:
  ```sh
  pnpm test
  ```
- Prettier and ESLint are enforced via pre-commit hooks.

## ü§ù Contributing
- All new features and fixes must be developed in a separate branch.
- Submit a Pull Request with a clear description of the purpose and changes.
- All tests must pass before requesting a review.
- Do not merge directly into the main branch.
- See [rules](.cursor-rules.json) for full conventions and collaboration guidelines.

## üìú Rules & Conventions
- See [.cursor-rules.json](.cursor-rules.json) for all project rules, conventions, and architecture.
- All contributors must follow these rules to ensure code quality and consistency.

## üìã Challenge Requirements
- Micro frontends architecture (ecommerce & checkout as separate apps)
- Data from Fake Store API
- Componentization and code reuse
- Responsive and accessible design
- UI library (TailwindCSS + tailwind-variants)
- Smooth navigation between micro frontends (via Nginx)
- Automated tests for main flows
- Docker Compose for local development
